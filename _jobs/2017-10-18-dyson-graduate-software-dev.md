When you invent something, the right technology often doesn't exist to make it work. So we make our own. From advanced systems, components and power supplies to building a digital motor from scratch, our ambitions continue to increase. We’re also advancing ever further into the worlds of connectivity, sensor technology, machine learning and AI. We’re building our capacity to work at the forefront of these fields and are striving for 15 million connected machines in homes and workplaces across the globe. We need the brightest minds to help us achieve this by 2020.

## Market Overview

Home to our global Research, Design and Development centre and all of our Commercial functions, the Dyson HQ campus can be found in secluded countryside that helps keep our secrets secret. Having doubled in size in 2016, the campus is now home to new research and development facilities, a new restaurant (home to an English Electric Lightning jet) and a sports facility catering to all Dyson people. Nearby are the fashionable cities of Bristol and Bath (where a young James Dyson invented cyclone technology).

The building is the heartbeat of Dyson. Over 3,000 people, including James himself, spend their days there strategizing, inventing technology and telling the Dyson story to the world.

## Function Overview

When you invent something, the right technology often doesn't exist to make it work. So we make our own. From advanced systems, components and power supplies to building a digital motor from scratch, our ambitions continue to increase. We’re also advancing ever further into the worlds of connectivity, sensor technology, machine learning and AI. We’re building our capacity to work at the forefront of these fields and are striving for 15 million connected machines in homes and workplaces across the globe. We need the brightest minds to help us achieve this by 2020.

## Accountabilities

Our internships last between 3 – 12 months and from day one you’ll be assigned to a live project team where you’ll be supporting the evolution of Dyson technology.

To make our machines intelligent we need a broad range of electronics skills across software, robotics and hardware. Depending on your discipline and skillset you could be working within our software team on real time embedded software, Mobile App development, debugging, cloud computing or fast prototyping in C/C++. If your specialism is within hardware, you could be designing the hardware that makes our machines reliable, from components to power systems or motors.

Whatever you’re doing the work will be challenging, varied and you’ll be in the thick of things. You’ll be interacting with teams across Research, Design & Development (RDD) including product developers ensuring our solutions are functional, secure and easy to use.

So as well as the technical know-how and passion to learn more, you’ll need to be inquisitive by nature, enthusiastic about technology, creative and tenacious in your approach to problem solving.

## Skills

Our internships are competitive so you’ll need to be on track for a 2:1 or above in any of the following (or related) disciplines:
- Computer Science
- Software Development
- Electrical/Electronic Engineering
- Robotics

A passion for technology is essential. You’ll be able to evidence how you have applied technical knowledge to solve problems either through your studies, own projects or extra-curricular activities. As you’ll be contributing from the start you’ll be hungry to learn and ready to get stuck in to make an impact.

## Benefits Overview

Do all this and in return you’ll get a competitive salary, generous holiday allowance and access to our free on site gym. But financial benefits are only the start of a Dyson career. With a vibrant culture, the latest devices and a relaxed dress code reflecting our engineering spirit, it’s an exciting team environment geared to creativity, innovation and ambition.
