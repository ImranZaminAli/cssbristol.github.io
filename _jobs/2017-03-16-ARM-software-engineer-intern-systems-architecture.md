The Architecture and Technology Group in Cambridge (UK) explores future technologies and creates next-generation extensions to the ARM architecture.
In this role, you will contribute to the development of new technology including hardware and software features that are not yet available to users and developers, typically 3-5 years before these systems are released as commercial products; features that will be used by fellow engineers across the industry to create world-beating products using ARM technology.

At our global HQ in Cambridge, England we house the majority of our engineering and our corporate groups that deliver our extraordinary success. As a world-renowned university town, Cambridge boasts both a beautiful countryside and a historical town centre. Local activities include punting on the River Cam and the many museums that reside within Cambridge University.
