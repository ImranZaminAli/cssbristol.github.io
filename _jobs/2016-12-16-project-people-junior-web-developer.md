I'm currently running a small team of developers working on a web application that's been around since about 2008. The project has grown immensely in that time and we're at a point where we need to put another brain in the mix. This role will be assisting me and my team in ongoing improvement of the web application. This can be things like adding big chunks of functionality or making the UX nicer but also small jobs like bug-fixes.

I'm looking to take someone on full-time to add to my team. While we do have a specific technology stack on the back-end, I'm not actually too worried if it's not something you've worked on before, as I consider the role to be one where you can learn on the job. If you're a strong web developer on other platforms and also have decent front end skills then I'm interested. If you can bring some cool new tech we've not been using that's definitely a bonus.

Our stack is CentOS+Java+Tomcat+Struts2+Hibernate+MySQL+JSP. It's more fun than you might expect, and if you're a non-Java programmer let me assure you that Java is a fantastic language that will improve your coding habits and give you loads of room to have fun. I made the switch from PHP to join this team years ago and haven't regretted a moment of it. Longer term I'm looking at swapping Struts out for the Play framework and adding some MongoDB to the mix for certain things that I think would benefit from it. Of course if you come along with some better ideas and cooler tech that may end up changing the plan.

If you end up joining my team you'll have bags of fun and learn new and exciting tech. Our developer turnover is very low (only 1 has left in the last 4 years) which tells me it's not a bad place to work, and while we don't have a drum kit in the office or slides instead of stairs, we do treat you like a grown-up and give you the autonomy you need to be creative.

If this sounds like your cup of tea/coffee/other please get in touch so we can figure out whether it's something you want to do, and figure out the next steps.
