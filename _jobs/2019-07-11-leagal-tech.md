## Job Description
The UoBâ€™s Industrial Liaison Office (ILO) and Osborne Clarke have teamed up to offer an exclusive two-week paid placement in September, focused on emerging technologies in the legal world.

Award-winning multinational law firm Osborne Clarke has grown rapidly over recent years, with 25 offices around the world. The core sectors they work in all thrive on innovation; digital business, energy, financial services, life sciences, real estate, recruitment and transport.

## Job Responsibilities
Based within their IT team, these technology-focused placements will allow you to evaluate legal and emerging technologies and assess if they are viable and of use to Osborne Clarke; invaluable real-world experience in legal tech. While these roles will be based in their IT team, it will be necessary for you to work with a cross-section of individuals, from associate to partner, as well as their OC Solutions and business support teams. You will also be paired up with a student from our Law School and working as a team you will research new technologies in a particular legal practice area.

## Educational Requirements
They are looking for UoB Computer Science and Engineering Mathematics students (BEng, 2nd year only; MEng, 2nd & 3rd years only).
