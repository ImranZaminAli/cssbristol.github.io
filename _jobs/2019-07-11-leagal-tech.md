## Job Description
The UoBâ€™s Industrial Liaison Office (ILO) and Osborne Clarke have teamed up to offer an exclusive two-week paid placement in September, focused on emerging technologies in the legal world.

Award-winning multinational law firm Osborne Clarke has grown rapidly over recent years, with 25 offices around the world. The core sectors they work in all thrive on innovation; digital business, energy, financial services, life sciences, real estate, recruitment and transport.

## Job Responsibilities
Based within their IT team, these technology-focused placements will allow you to evaluate legal and emerging technologies and assess if they are viable and of use to Osborne Clarke; invaluable real-world experience in legal tech. While these roles will be based in their IT team, it will be necessary for you to work with a cross-section of individuals, from associate to partner, as well as their OC Solutions and business support teams. You will also be paired up with a student from our Law School and working as a team you will research new technologies in a particular legal practice area.

## Educational Requirements
They are looking for UoB Computer Science and Engineering Mathematics students (BEng, 2nd year only; MEng, 2nd & 3rd years only).

## Desired skills
They are looking for applicants with a problem-solving approach, excellent communication skills and a team-working ethos.

## Other Benefits

The project work may continue beyond the initial 2-week placement on an ad-hoc basis, and Osborne Clarke will work with selected students to establish how this could work with their existing university commitments. Any additional work would be paid at the same rate as the placement.

In addition:
 
* Please note that these placements may not involve any coding or development work, but will primarily focus on researching emerging third-party solutions
* The placement will likely take place between 9-20th September 2019
* Interviews will be in August and can be held via Skype if necessary
* Reasonable travel expenses to an interview could be covered. If invited to interview, please ask before booking anything
