[Myrtle](https://myrtlesoftware.com) is looking for students interested in interning at our office in Cambridge. We're writing a compiler for generating highly efficient hardware designs implementing machine learning solutions.

We use Haskell for every aspect of our work and interns will get the chance to be involved in every part of the project. All of our past interns have had a real positive impact on the work we're doing. Some examples of work interns have previously done at Myrtle are:

- Designing and implementing a protocol for sending data between the FPGA and host computer from scratch
- Implementing a browser based GUI for modifying variables in the running hardware design in real time.
- Writing reference functions for checking the output of hardware designs.

Specific tasks you could be working on soon include:

- Implementing fixed point neural network evaluation support in our compiler
- Supporting AWS F1 instances as a backend
- Investigating and implementing exciting techniques for neural network evaluation such as the Winograd small convolution algorithm and realising full hardware implementations of existing neural networks.

A familiarity and interest with hardware design would be viewed positively but is not essential. Applicants should be familiar with Unix based systems; all our development is done on Ubuntu or NixOS.
