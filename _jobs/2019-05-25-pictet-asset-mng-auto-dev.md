## The Company
Pictet Asset Management is an independent asset manager, overseeing over £136 billion (as at 31st December 2018) for our clients across a range of equity, fixed income, alternative and multi asset products. We provide specialist investment services through segregated accounts and investment funds to some of the world’s largest pension funds, financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds, intermediaries and their clients. In line with our continued commitment to investing in new technologies and methods, we are looking to update and renovate a number of our core processes. In many cases this includes the use of automation of processes, tasks and controls, as well as the building of wholly new support tools to further drive efficiency across the business. Part of this includes construction of an AI Chatbot, to be put to use by the Business Support team. Moving forward we would like this chatbot to be employed across the Pictet Asset Management (PAM) business. There are also several other systems and processes within PAM which we are currently looking to automate. All of these have major implications for both our employees and our clients, and, we think, require new and modern methods of thinking to achieve the best results. The addition of a new Automation Developer is therefore of paramount importance to achieving these goals.

## Job Responsibilities
You will report to the Head of Production and Business Support. As Automation Developer, you will sit within the Business Support team, and will liaise with departments throughout PAM globally, including DevOps and Data Science teams. You will design, develop and implement productivity and automation tools for use within the Business Support team and PAM more broadly. This will include the creation of the aforementioned chatbot function, as well as the automation of other processes, tasks and controls and the creation and development of new software. Although systems like the ones you’ll be working with are usually built in Python, some components will require knowledge of other languages such as Java and .NET. You will also be responsible for formulating effective and engaging business cases as part of the application creation and development roadmap, as well as for the presentation and demonstration of solutions to peers and internal clients throughout PAM. You will provide Application Support and Incident Management for the entire investment platform, incorporating the applications used by PAM globally.
