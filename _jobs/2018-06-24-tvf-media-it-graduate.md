TVF Media is dynamic and progressive media company that is experiencing a period of rapid growth within its multiple media platforms. We currently have a rare opportunity for an outstanding graduate to join us as an IT Support and Systems Graduate Trainee in the heart of London’s Tech City.<br/>
We pride ourselves for having successfully created our own systems in-house, rather than deploying commercial off-the-shelf packages and we are looking for someone to help us continue its development and creation. The successful candidate will be supported directly by the senior managers and directors in the group, learning about every element of what it takes to build and run bespoke IT and performance management infrastructures for an award-winning media company.<br/> During an intensive three-month training period you will gain a detailed knowledge of our network and the systems we operate. You will be involved in the maintenance and consistent running of our computing systems across the group, as well as exciting new projects to improve what we are doing operationally and financially through the use of technology. You will get to work with a variety of technologies and you will experience a number of roles including business analysis, helpdesk support, software package configuration, technical solution design and technical project management both internally and for our diverse range of clients. This includes work for Quarter, a hotel and leisure group in Bristol. Therefore an interest in and aptitude for both hardware and programming is essential as well as the desire to create real change in an organisation. <br/> All candidates should have an excellent educational background with a minimum 2:1 degree from a top university. A degree in computer science, mathematics or another highly numerate subject would be a great advantage but is not essential if you can show interest and aptitude. Linux experience and some knowledge of Microsoft Excel are also desirable.<br/> If you think you can display an inventive approach to the current technological landscape, are keen to pursue a career in IT and Management, and have a desire to take on high-level responsibility early in your career, please apply now: http://www.tvf.co.uk/careers/tvf-plc/technology-and-systems-trainee Salary £20-25k dependant upon experience.
