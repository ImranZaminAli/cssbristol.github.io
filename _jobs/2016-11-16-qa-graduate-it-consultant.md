Fast-track your career in IT consultancy

Great jobs in IT are hard to find and gaining experience can be just as difficult. Even if you are straight out of university, the latest technology can quickly leave you behind.

During our Graduate programme, we will train you to work as an IT consultant in the latest, in-demand software. We will then get you out into the real world, working for some of the most recognisable organisations in the UK.

The 12-weeks' training is free and is based in the heart of Media City Manchester. We offer a training bursary which allows you to cover all your living costs while you are in Manchester. Once you’re working on-site, you'll receive a competitive salary - plus bags of experience you will struggle to find anywhere else.

So, what's the catch? None. Zilch. Nada.

Naturally, we're looking for the smartest, most ambitious graduates from Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. And we will only ask you to commit to QA Consulting for a minimum of two years while we continue to build your technical, project and business experience.

Sure, starting your career after graduating is a big step. So, our experienced team are here to offer you advice and support to help with your move to one of the most vibrant cities in the UK. During your time on our Graduate programme you will get connected with a growing team of young, like-minded graduates and if that's not enough, we will invite you to the annual QA Consulting conference abroad, in 2016 this is being held in Barcelona.

Add it all together and it's no surprise that we have achieved some outstanding external praise including:

* Voted 4th in a poll of Top Technical Companies for Graduates to work for
* Microsoft Worldwide Learning Partner of the Year
