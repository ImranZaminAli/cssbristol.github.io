The Whip (www.whip.org.uk, www.facebook.com/thewhipmagazine) is UoB's online student satire magazine. We are looking for a web developer to help us with our Wordpress site, which we've been having some problems with lately. If you have had experience with the Newspaper theme then that would be great. This initial issue may only take a day to resolve, but we would continue to hire you on a freelance basis after this time, if needed.
