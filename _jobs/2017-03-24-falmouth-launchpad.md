We're looking for graduates or industry-experienced individuals with skills in:

- Software development
- Business & entrepreneurship
- Creative digital

Launchpad is an innovative incubation and acceleration programme starting in May 2017, designed to place talented programmers in teams that incubate into investible companies. The programme offers you paid opportunities to forge the growth of digital sectors in Cornwall, the UK and worldwide. You will work on a new start-up and through business support, mentoring and applied boot camp training, leave as a director in a viable, sustainable business.

Launchpad is underpinned by an MA in Entrepreneurship (with no attached fees), which provides the requisite knowledge and skills to drive the development of a new high-growth potential tech start-up. The MA is designed to complement the incubation of the business through supporting Launchpad students to gain, analyse and apply knowledge to entrepreneurship, business governance and operation, innovation management, negotiation and presentation techniques and effective communication.

Launchpad start-ups require a number of skillsets, so we welcome applications from people with various graduate and professional backgrounds who possess entrepreneurial ambition. Typically, these include:

- Programmers
- Business developers & entrepreneurs
- Digital designers, e.g. UI/UX
- 3D artists and animators
- Game designers & developers
- Web developers

Competition for entry onto the programme is fierce and we advise early application. In order to provide the appropriate level of business support and mentoring, Launchpad is accepting 20 students for the 2017 entry and these places will be filled as soon as the right candidates are found.
