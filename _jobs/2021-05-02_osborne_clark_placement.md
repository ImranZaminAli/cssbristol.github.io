The ILO, the Law School, and law firm Osborne Clarke, have teamed up again to offer Computer Science and Engineering Maths students, currently in their first or second year, exclusive two-week paid placements in September 2021. The placements will focus on emerging technologies in the legal world.



Award-winning multinational law firm Osborne Clarke has grown rapidly over recent years, with 25 offices around the world. The core sectors they work in all thrive on innovation, digital business, energy, financial services, life sciences, real estate, recruitment and transport. They are looking for candidates who are passionate about legal tech to join them in September for a two-week placement. Based within their IT team, these technology-focused placements will allow students to evaluate legal and emerging technologies and assess if they are viable and of use to Osborne Clarke. While these roles will be based in their IT team, it will be necessary for students to work with a cross-section of individuals, from associate to partner, as well as their OC Solutions and business support teams.
