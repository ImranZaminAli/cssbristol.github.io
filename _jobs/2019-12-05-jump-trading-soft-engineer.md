## Job Description
ABOUT THE COMPANY – Jump Trading
Jump Trading is a leading algorithmic trading firm built on cutting-edge technology, sophisticated quantitative research, and an entrepreneurial culture. Founded in 1999, Jump now has 700 employees across offices in Chicago, New York, London, Bristol, Amsterdam, Singapore, and Shanghai.

Jump is still privately owned and funded, fostering a culture of intellectual curiosity and learning. Our people are some of the world’s most brilliant minds, with backgrounds from the trading industry, Silicon Valley tech companies and startups, top PhD programs and research labs.

We have a 20-year history of investing in superior infrastructure, including custom hardware, low-latency software, wireless networks, and a world-class supercomputer.

We’ve built custom technology to power our high-performance, distributed systems and to identify trends in massive data sets across global markets.

ABOUT THE ROLE – Software Engineer (Bristol)
You’ll be joining our core software development team that designs, codes, tests, and maintains our high-performance, distributed systems that enables trading on more than 60 financial exchanges and processing multi-petabyte datasets on one of the most powerful computing grids in the world.

Our new graduate hires work alongside experienced engineers and learn advanced skills in C++, Python, SDLC, and test automation. This will also give you opportunities to learn about all aspects of our world-class technology infrastructure and to contribute to the work of our technology groups focused on market data, order entry, risk management, simulation and/or UI development.

## Experience Requirements
What you’ll need:

Any degree discipline
Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or related field
Strong experience with C++ programming on Linux
Deep understanding of data structures, threading models, and networking
Ability to work efficiently in a team that is deploying new software daily
Passion for solving complex problems and learning to build optimal solutions from scratch, instead of simply assembling things from existing libraries
Interest in using knowledge from several areas -- such as hardware, networking, OS design -- to produce extremely high-performance software

* No finance or economics study or work experience required

Other helpful and related experience:


- Advanced coursework in algorithms, operating systems, compilers
- Experience working in small- to mid-sized software development groups
