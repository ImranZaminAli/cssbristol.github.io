## Job Description
The I Didn't Buy project (https://ididntbuy.org) is investigating how to empower people to shop sustainably with respect to the climate crisis and other environmental and social emergencies. As part of our research, we are creating a prototype extension for the chrome browser which will offer an interface relating to products and brands as the user browses for them. We seek a student / recent graduate intern with good experience of JavaScript programming to help build this extension under the supervision of Tim Kindberg of matter II media (https://matter2media.com), based at the Pervasive Media Studio, Watershed, Bristol. While some of the mechanisms are known, this is a research project and so will suit someone who is comfortable working independently as far as possible, without a complete specification of what is to be produced. The work, which is funded by Bristol University's Brigstow Institute, will be under contract to matter II media at a rate of Â£85/day for 20 days in total until end July. To apply, send your CV and a brief covering letter with reference contact details and links to relevant JavaScript work to tim@matter2media.com. Deadline for applications is 17:00 Wed 20 May.

## Job Responsibilities

## Educational Requirements
