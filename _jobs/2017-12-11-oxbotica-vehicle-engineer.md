Oxbotica is the UK’s leading autonomous systems provider, with a fleet of vehicles using our know-how to drive themselves across the world, on public and private roads, off-highway, and even on Mars. We’re a fast-moving and fast-growing team of human and robot brains, and we’re looking for talented graduate engineers of all disciplines to help transform mobility.
In return you’ll have unparalleled access to some of the world’s best robotics expertise and the opportunity to have a real impact on an industry going through its biggest transformation in a century.

## Responsibilities

You’ll be getting deep into our autonomy system and understanding how it can work better from the vehicle level. You’ll spend a lot of time on the road (and off-road) pushing the hardware and software to its limits and working across all teams to report on and improve vehicle performance, especially developing low-level software and tools. You’ll have good ideas for how to improve the sensor and computer hardware and have input into the design, installation and calibration of new platforms. You’ll also have responsibility for liaising with customers and suppliers at all levels, so it’s essential that you’re a confident communicator.

Most importantly, you’ll pick up new responsibilities as you develop within the company. We move fast and so do you.

## Essential Skills & Experience

- You have the right to work in the UK, and are willing to work from our office in Oxford and testing ground at Culham.
- You’re about to, or have recently graduated from a top university with at least a 2:1 degree in an Engineering, Physics or Computer Science based subject.
- You have experience understanding complex systems and applying your knowledge to improve performance both in the tiny details and at a wider system level.
- We’re at the forefront of the UK autonomy industry because of an incredible team. You’ll need to fit with our culture (but don’t worry, we’re friendly)
- Fast Learner – you’ll need to pick up cutting-edge technologies and concepts quickly.
- Adaptable – Oxbotica is a dynamic company; you’ll need to have or be able to develop a wide skill base.

## Desirable Skills & Experience

- Software: Linux, Python, Qt, Matlab/Simulink, C++.
- Work experience in an automotive, software or other technical environment.
- We’re especially looking for automotive-oriented engineers with a mix of software and hardware skills, or the desire to learn them.

## Benefits we offer:

- A competitive salary, including share options.
- An opportunity to learn from the best in the business, and to grow your career in the most exciting industry there is.
- A relaxed startup environment and a flat organisational structure.
