Think you could inspire the next generation? Our award-winning Insight Programme is your opportunity to get one step closer to our [Leadership Development Programme (LDP)](https://graduates.teachfirst.org.uk/leadership-development-programme)...

A two-week paid internship, Insight will help you to develop key employability skills and inspire young people in school studying science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). You will spend the first week at our London office focusing on training and personal development, attending sessions with the Teach First team, our Platinum Partners, ambassadors (alumni) and a selection of our partner social enterprises.

This will prepare you for the second week, where you will be placed in one of our partner schools across England and Wales. The programme will give you the opportunity not only to teach your own lesson, but to find out more about the problem of educational inequality first-hand.

If you're looking to develop the kinds of skills that employers look for - teamwork, resilience, confidence, communication - this internship is ideal. There are also plenty of opportunities to make professional connections, engage with our work, and find out how you can continue to work with Teach First in the future. Insight participants are eligible to fast-track through the initial stages of the application process for our Leadership Development Programme, and our Brand Manager Programme.
