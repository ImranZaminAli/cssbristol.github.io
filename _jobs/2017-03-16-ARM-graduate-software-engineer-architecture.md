skills:
- skill: Good grounding in computer architecture fundamentals (including the interaction between hardware and software, instruction sets, memory subsystems, etc.)
- skill: Experience/project work related to low-level software (e.g., DSP, device drivers, operating systems, compilers, microcontroller projects)
- skill: Experience with source code control and the software development process
responsibilities:
- The activities for this role demand an enthusiastic candidate from either a Computer Science or Electrical Engineering background with a strong desire to constantly evolve a cross-disciplinary skill set, in particular
- Development of prototypes to visualise and analyse the performance of next-generation extensions to the ARM architecture.
- Investigations to help drive technical decisions across a broad spectrum of features, including architecture, software and hardware.
- Specification and implementation of new instruction set extensions.
- Development of the instruction set architecture specification tools and validation process.
educationRequirements:
- As a successful Graduate Engineer, you will be flexible with a variety of software development skills and a commitment to extend the breadth and depth of your knowledge. You will have a good university degree, ideally in Computer Science or Electrical/Electronic Engineering, although candidates with other academic backgrounds would also be considered if they have the relevant skills. You will have a strong interest in computer architecture and the interaction between software and hardware in a real system. You will possess a research mindset that seeks to find and communicate the best answers to complex technical problems based on systematic investigation.
experienceRequirements:
- Good programming skills in at least one high-level language like C or C++
- Knowledge of scripting languages, such as Python, Perl, Ruby, or Unix shell
- Familiarity with assembly language programming
- Pro-active and self-motivated

The Architecture and Technology Group in Cambridge (UK) is responsible for exploring future technologies to design next-generation extensions to the ARM architecture. We are seeking someone able to help us model and analyse software behaviour and its hardware implications as part of architecture exploration, definition and refinement. This often involves developing prototypes and models not yet available to the general public – typically 3-5 years before these systems are released as commercial products by ARM partners.

As a member of a small and dynamic team, you will be working alongside technology experts across ARM, contributing to the development of instruction set architectures for general-purpose processors that will be used by millions of people

The activities for this role demand an enthusiastic candidate from either a Computer Science or Electrical Engineering background with a strong desire to constantly evolve a cross-disciplinary skill set, in particular:

- Development of prototypes to visualise and analyse the performance of next-generation extensions to the ARM architecture.
- Investigations to help drive technical decisions across a broad spectrum of features, including architecture, software and hardware.
- Specification and implementation of new instruction set extensions.
- Development of the instruction set architecture specification tools and validation process.

The ARM architecture is at the heart of the organisation, driving current and future developments across the company. You will play an essential role in helping to develop next-generation processor architectures in areas like computer vision, machine learning, virtualisation, multiprocessing and security among others.

At our global HQ in Cambridge, England we house the majority of our engineering and our corporate groups that deliver our extraordinary success. As a world-renowned university town, Cambridge boasts both a beautiful countryside and a historical town center. Local activities include punting on the River Cam and the many museums that reside within Cambridge University.
