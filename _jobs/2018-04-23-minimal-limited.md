Full Stack Web Developer & Junior Data Scientist: Miminal has an ongoing contract to develop an MVP for a new startup company implementing bespoke AI in the engineering project management space. We are looking for an intern to help in the development of the user-facing React/Meteor webapp for this project. The webapp will display data driven interactive visuals for project managers. Later work will potentially be on optimising other components of the MVP such as the data analytics, AI or data infrastructure. There is also scope to work on other exciting projects that we are working on as a company with details yet to be confirmed. The successful candidate will be enthusiastic about new product development and working in a dynamic team in a small start up. They will be a great communicator and understand the responsibilities of being a core component of a small team, but will also gain satisfaction in having direct influence on project progress and company output. They will be an independent problem solver and a competent programmer, with previous experience developing webapps and an understanding of cloud infrastructure. Finally they will have a keen interest in deploying data science to solve real world problems.
