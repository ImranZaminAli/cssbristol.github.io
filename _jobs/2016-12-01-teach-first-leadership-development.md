Young people in low-income communities need leaders to bring out the best in them. We support exceptional people like you to become leaders through our two-year Leadership Development Programme in schools across the country.

You’ll gain a fully-funded Postgraduate Diploma, worth double the credits of a PGCE, and coaching to develop your leadership qualities. If you can inspire in the classroom, you can bring resilience, efficiency and imagination to any environment, wherever your career takes you.

Did you know that our many supporters including Google, Bloomberg and PWC offer internships exclusively for Teach First participants which frequently result in a full time offer after you complete 2 years on the programme.

Not only that, but those teaching Computer Science with Teach First are guaranteed an internship with Google. Last year of the participants who took part in PWC’s internship, 98% were offered a full time role as a result and Deloitte have openly stated that their employees who completed our programme progress 5 times faster than their peers who didn't.

Apply now for a career-defining opportunity. We strongly recommend early application to avoid disappointment.
