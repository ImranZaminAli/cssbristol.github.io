Epimorphics are looking for enthusiastic interns to come and gain experience from a company at the forefront of knowledge-graph and linked data technologies. There are positions available for software developers and are open to undergraduates, postgraduates, or people looking to gain experience.
About you
You’ll be writing software, so you’ll need to be familiar with at least one programming language, and excited about the idea of learning and working with new languages, libraries or technologies. We mostly work in Java, JavaScript, Ruby and Kotlin, so familiarity with any of those languages would be an advantage.
We are looking to not just give you hands-on development experience, but also a working knowledge of how to work collaboratively within a project team. Each intern will have one or more mentors from the company who will guide them and the project over the duration of the internship.
About us
We are a team of passionate people who love solving interesting challenges. Our team includes accomplished computer scientists and data experts who helped define the standards in the Semantic Web and Linked Data. We’ve built ground-breaking linked-data services for the public sector here in the UK and elsewhere. Many of our public sector and open-data projects have a direct positive benefit for society.
About the internship
We’d like you to have time to make a solid contribution to our work, so this position is expected to last for three months over the summer. Our interns typically join us in July and finish late September.
Salary will be paid at a rate of £1,500 per month.
