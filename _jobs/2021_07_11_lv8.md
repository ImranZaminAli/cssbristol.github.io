## Job Description
Based in Battersea, London, LV8 Sport is a privately funded sports-tech startup, leveraging Computer Vision and Machine Learning to deliver a unique data-led approach to performance analysis across a select group of sports. Our first product, Grow Football, is an AR-based iOS application which provides players of all levels with detailed analysis of their performance, and is launching this summer with a top European football club.

Due to one of our data scientists moving into a neuroscience research position, we have a vacancy available for a Junior Data Scientist, starting in July/August of this year.
