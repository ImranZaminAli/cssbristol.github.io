Creditcall develops the most trusted payment software for mobile, online and in-store that is relied on in 38 countries, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Founded in 1996 with offices in Bristol and New York, our payment technology powers millions of customers worldwide, ensuring they can take payments worth billions, securely and reliably.

You've probably used our software when ordering a burger, paying for parking or booking a train ticket - without realising it! If you want to join a team of industry leading experts, are passionate, talented, and ambitious and want to drive the continued development, we want to hear from you!

We are looking for a developer with broad knowledge and breadth of skills to join our development team. The team is responsible for the continued advancement of Creditcallâ€™s card processing platform and services including but not limited to: integrations with banks (acquirers and processors), interfaces for customers, bespoke solutions, and software for payment devices, storage and processing of transaction data, high availability solutions, automatic failover, software security and processing redundancy.

The ideal candidate will have experience in C#, but candidates with experience in other object-oriented languages will be considered. The projects for which the developer will participate will vary within the areas for which the development team is responsible, but will primarily be focused around the integrations with banks (acquirers and processors) for the processing of card based transactions. These transactions come in the form of manually keyed transactions, magnetic swipe transactions, contactless and full Chip-and-PIN transactions. It is necessary to use a combination of the data that we receive from integrators, devices and databases, build the correct messages (as per the acquirer specifications), send them for processing, and manage the response with all associated error conditions. Consideration also has to be given to performance, availability and reliability.

- An understanding of networking principals and protocols such as sockets, HTTPS, DNS and SSL
- Attention to detail in all aspects of development and customer contact
- Good communication skills; both written and verbal for dealing with suppliers and project partners

## Desired skills

- Understanding of Secure Programming Practices

- Experience in the payment processing industry
