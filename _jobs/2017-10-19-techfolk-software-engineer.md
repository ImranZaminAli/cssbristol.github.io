Fresh8 Gaming is hiring for a junior back end software engineer, coding in Golang, Node.js and Python.

We'll provide cross-training to learn Node.js, Python and Golang - the popular language from Google - to advance the technology that underpins our high throughput content serving platform.

This is a chance to learn Golang from the team that has been using it in production for over four years and quickly you'll be contributing writing clean, well tested code.

Golang is a static compiled language, notable for its simple syntax, built-in concurrency support, and feature-rich standard library. It's aimed at helping Developers build apps at Google's scale and speed, including projects such as Docker and Kubernetes, with a focus on rock-solid performance and ease of use. Go is seeing rapid development from Google, and is backed by a growing ecosystem of developers and projects.

Our philosophy is to use the right tool for the job, choosing Hashicorp Consul for health checks and distributed service discovery, Docker (Moby) for streamlining development and integrations tests, Aerospike for super fast persistent key value storage, Google BigQuery for storing a huge amount of our analytics data ready for machine learning, and Google PubSub as an asynchronous messaging queue. We also use Postgres and Redis, both of which have been battle tested over a number of years in enterprise environments.

We’re about collaboration and openness, with a fairly flat team structure. We’re fast moving and we iterate and ship code fast. We offer a strong technical challenge and ongoing personal development from the many milestones ahead. We believe in open source and contribute wherever possible, check us out on Github.

We're currently working on:

- Using the speed of Go to scale incoming requests to 10k per second
- Enhancing analytics data for training neural networks to create a behaviour-driven recommendations engine
- Investigating automation and code generation to drive developer efficiency
- Combining Docker with CircleCI workflows to test our microservice infrastructure and provide continuous delivery

We'll help you get up to speed on our technology mix:

<p>Golang | microservices | Node.js | Python | BigQuery | Prometheus | PostgreSQL | Redis | distributed systems | Google Pub/Sub | GCP technologies | machine learning | data mining | Kanban | TDD | and more...</p>
