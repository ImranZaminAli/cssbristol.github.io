Please [apply by email](mailto:jobs@artandideas.org?subject=Digital Content Trainee), attaching your CV and Cover Letter.

This is a remarkable opportunity to play a key part in the growth of a rapidly expanding and unique organisation, the Institute of Art and Ideas (IAI).The IAI team are originating and developing cutting edge ideas and conveying them to the wider public through events, festivals and our educational media platforms, described by the Guardian as “Europe's answer to TED”.  
As a Digital Content Trainee you will need strategic and creative vision, along with the technical knowledge, to help a small dynamic team of exceptionally talented individuals deliver cutting edge digital campaigns, and exponential website traffic. You will help grow the digital side of the IAI and drive ongoing success through web analytics.

The ideal candidate will have 1-2 years of experience in digital marketing on a technical and strategic level and be able to demonstrate evidence of planning and delivering successful digital marketing campaigns. Demonstrable experience in website and content management is essential, along with a confident understanding of SEO to create high value affiliates. Knowledge of Google Analytics is a must, alongside a proven ability to interpret and respond to data patterns to drive traffic. Above all we are looking for someone with flair and drive who is engaged with our work and sees the potential for the web as the driving force of cultural change.

We are looking for candidates who will be excited by the potential of this role and the talent to be able to deliver.  For the right candidate there is opportunity for the role to develop quickly. At the IAI we favour internal promotions to external hires, allowing many to grow from interns to managers in a short time period; the role will benefit from that vision and ensure progression to candidates who shine.

All candidates will need to be able to demonstrate a strong academic background with at least a 2.1 from a leading university along with 1+ years’ experience in digital marketing and communications.
