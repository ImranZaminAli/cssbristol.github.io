We are looking for an easy-going, skilled and flexible freelance front-end developer to handle some of the support requests that we receive from users looking for help with the code in their products. Sometimes this can be down to user error, but often it is because we are continually refining our products and some of the code needs to be tweaked to work better with their website, or just to work better in general!
