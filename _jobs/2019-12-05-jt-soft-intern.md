## Job Description
ABOUT THE COMPANY – Jump Trading
Jump Trading is a leading algorithmic trading firm built on cutting-edge technology, sophisticated quantitative research, and an entrepreneurial culture. Founded in 1999, Jump now has 700 employees across offices in Chicago, New York, London, Bristol, Amsterdam, Singapore, and Shanghai.

Jump is still privately owned and funded, fostering a culture of intellectual curiosity and learning. Our people are some of the world’s most brilliant minds, with backgrounds from the trading industry, Silicon Valley tech companies and startups, top PhD programs and research labs.

We have a 20-year history of investing in superior infrastructure, including custom hardware, low-latency software, wireless networks, and a world-class supercomputer.

We’ve built custom technology to power our high-performance, distributed systems and to identify trends in massive data sets across global markets.

 
ABOUT THE ROLE –  Software Engineering Internship (Bristol)
Our software engineering internship is an intensive 10-week experience within our core development team that designs, codes, tests, and maintains our distributed trading system. 

You will learn the fundamentals of a large-scale, high-performance infrastructure; sharpen your C++ programming skills; and see what it’s like to work as a full-time software engineer at Jump. 

Throughout your internship you will take on projects targeted for production, which go through our full-cycle process for development, testing, and release using Agile methodologies. 

You will be working side by side with our experienced software engineers and you’ll receive ongoing feedback and coaching from a dedicated mentor throughout the summer. 

Our internship program is the primary way we identify top young software engineers for our core development team, and it’s a proven path for earning full-time opportunities at Jump. 

## Experience Requirements
What you’ll need:

Experience with C++ programming on Linux
Strong understanding of data structures and threading models
Ability to work with a team in a fast-paced environment, deploying new software daily
Passion for solving complex problems and learning to build optimal solutions from scratch, instead of  simply assembling things from existing libraries
Interest in using knowledge from several areas -- such as hardware, networking, OS design -- to produce extremely high-performance software

* No finance or economics study or work experience required
Other helpful and related experience:
Past internship or job experience in a software development role is a plus
Advanced coursework in algorithms, network programming, operating systems, compilers
