Launched in April 2013, Fire Tech is the UK’s #1 technology day camp focusing on children aged 9-17. Fire Tech’s mission is to get young people creating and innovating using technology.

We are currently recruiting Tutors for our fantastic remote camps! If you are looking for a great role which you don’t need to commute for and can complete from anywhere in the world then please read on and apply!

(We are also looking for people who would be interested in teaching at our face-to-face camps and after school clubs, please also apply if you are keen)

Fire Tech was founded to bring important skills around computing, logic and innovation to students outside the classroom. Fire Tech sessions teach young people computing fundamentals as they create video games, mobile apps, arduinos and robots, digital music and animations, and as they learn to program in Python, Unity, HTML/CSS, Java and Greenfoot (and more). They design, experiment, look for feedback from peers and camp instructors, iterate, and pivot when necessary – all skills that we believe will be crucial for today’s students to become creative, resilient, adaptable adults. Please see our website to learn more about our goals, and the specific courses we currently offer:  ww.firetechcamp.com Fire Tech’s camp instructors are the heart and soul of the kids’ and teens’ camp experience. You will be at the front line of teaching our campers cutting edge subjects like programming, graphic design, robotics, digital music and much more!
