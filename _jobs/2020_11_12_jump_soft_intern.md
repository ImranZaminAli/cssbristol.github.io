## Job Description
Our software engineering internship is an intensive experience within our core development team that designs, codes, tests, and maintains our distributed trading system.

You will learn the fundamentals of a large-scale, high-performance infrastructure; sharpen your C++ programming skills; and see what it’s like to work as a full-time software engineer at Jump.

Throughout your internship you will take on projects targeted for production, which go through our full-cycle process for development, testing, and release using Agile methodologies.

You will be working side by side with our experienced software engineers and you’ll receive ongoing feedback and coaching from a dedicated mentor throughout the summer. May include other duties as assigned or needed.

Our internship program is the primary way we identify top young software engineers for our core development team, and it’s a proven path for earning full-time opportunities at Jump.
