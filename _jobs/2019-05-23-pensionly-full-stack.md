- Competitive pay & benefits 
- Located less than a mile from Bristol Temple Meads.â€¨
- You will be part of an early-stage startup with interest, moment, and huge potential ðŸ¦„.

## Extra points
- This role is initially a 3-month contract, with a view to permanent employment (contingent on funding & performance).
- This is a brilliant opportunity for someone who can build mobile apps, and backs themselves to learn more about construction and deployment of iOS and Android Apps.
- Youâ€™ll take a lead in shaping Pensionlyâ€™s technical direction at an early stage.
