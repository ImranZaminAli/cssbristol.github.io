We are looking for a developer with broad knowledge and breadth of skills to join our development team. The team is responsible for the continued advancement of Creditcall’s card processing platform and services including but not limited to: integrations with banks (acquirers and processors), interfaces for customers, bespoke solutions, and software for payment devices, storage and processing of transaction data, high availability solutions, automatic failover, software security and processing redundancy. The ideal candidate will have experience in C#, but candidates with experience in other object-oriented languages will be considered. The projects for which the developer will participate will vary within the areas for which the development team is responsible, but will primarily be focused around the integrations with banks (acquirers and processors) for the processing of card based transactions. These transactions come in the form of manually keyed transactions, magnetic swipe transactions, contactless and full Chip-and-PIN transactions. It is necessary to use a combination of the data that we receive from integrators, devices and databases, build the correct messages (as per the acquirer specifications), send them for processing, and manage the response with all associated error conditions.
