[Email Adam](mailto:ar1406@my.bristol.ac.uk) to find out more about the graduate scheme and how to apply.

You’re about to leave university with a lot of skills, a lot of knowledge, and a lot of options. What are you going to do with it all?

Our graduate rotation scheme is designed to give you first-hand experience of everything from automation controls to web development. Want to know where you’ll thrive the most? Here’s your chance to learn.

Over four six-month placements, you’ll work in teams across the Technology division, gaining knowledge and insight of the vast number of challenges we solve every day.

You could also have the opportunity to work abroad in one of our international offices.

We’re all about innovation and refusing to accept the status quo, so if you’re keen to push the limits of your learning – and our technology – we want to hear from you.

Here are some of the teams on the scheme:

* CFC Systems build resilient and scalable systems to move stock, orders and pickers through our automated CFC, using Java, Scala and Akka Framework. Their reporting platform also collects and processes vast amounts of data from each system.
* Lastmile are all about delighting the customer. They support the processes that get orders delivered efficiently, such as optimal vehicle routing and logistics tools, and own the CRM area in general – systems for emails, managing core customer data etc.
* Ecommerce build the websites for Ocado, Morrisons, Fetch, Sizzle and the newly launched Fabled, as well as iOS and Android apps. They’re a mix of developers and designers working together to provide a superb customer experience.
* Business Support & Supply Chain Systems develop software for a wide spectrum of business functions – everything from Finance Systems (customer payments, fraud detection tools etc) to forecasting, ordering and availability for demand managers in Supply Chain.
