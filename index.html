    so, we rely on the generosity of our sponsors; to join them, visit

    On 8&ndash;12th July, we'll invite young women from the local area to visit
    us for our upcoming summer school, Changemakers, held in partnership with 
    Digimakers and the Jean Golding Institute. <a href="//shop.bris.ac.uk/product-catalogue/engineering-mathematics/digimakers/digimakers-donations">
