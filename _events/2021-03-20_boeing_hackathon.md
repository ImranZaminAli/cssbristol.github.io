Our premier hackathon is back! See what you can make in 24 hours with a team of up to 6 other students.
This event is open to all courses & years, not just Computer Science. There are many kinds of projects you could take on, e.g: a piece of software; analysis on a dataset; a real-life piece of equipment... Further examples for each discipline will be put up later on.
Don't have a team you want to work with or worried you aren't skilled enough to take part? No worries - we can group you up with more experienced students, but we're sure you'll be able to come up with something regardless.

// THEME //
Life Under Water ðŸŒŠðŸŒ± - innovate in one of three areas:

Precise schedule, rules, and sign-up will be released closer to the date. Put 'Going' to make sure you receive updates!
