Our premier hackathon is back! See what you can make in 24 hours with a team of up to 6 other students.
This event is open to all courses & years, not just Computer Science. There are many kinds of projects you could take on, e.g: a piece of software; analysis on a dataset; a real-life piece of equipment... Further examples for each discipline will be put up later on.
Don't have a team you want to work with or worried you aren't skilled enough to take part? No worries - we can group you up with more experienced students, but we're sure you'll be able to come up with something regardless.

## THEME: Life Under Water ðŸŒŠðŸŒ±
Innovate in one of three areas:
1. Exploration
2. Environment
3. Communication

## Ideas for inspiration
- A simulation for controlling an underwater probe
- A tool that displays information about other marine vessels and their positions
- An educational app showing the effects of water pollution
- Looking at minimal action to perturb flow of plastic to change the location of garbage islands
- Looking at the movement of a submarine involving a 3d moving reinforcement learning algorithm
