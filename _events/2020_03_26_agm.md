CSS’ AGM is upon us once again! Join us in MVB 1.11(A) at 17:00, Friday 3rd May to vote on motions and committee nominees.

If you’re abroad this year or can’t attend the AGM - don’t worry! You can still nominate yourself/submit a motion. We recommend recording a short video of yourself speaking so that we can play it at the AGM. If you like, we can read out a written statement instead.

(Nominations for First-Year Rep and Post-Grad Rep will be occur after the start of the next university year)

Free pizza 🍕, falafel 🧆, and cider/beer 🍺 as per usual x
