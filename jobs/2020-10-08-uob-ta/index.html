        <p itemprop="description">
          <p>We are looking for four enthusiastic and hard-working individuals to support the delivery of Computer Science in the blended learning environment.</p>

<p>The new role of Year Group Teacher will work closely with the Head of Year of Year 1 (Tilo Burghardt) or Year 2 (Steven Ramsay) of the Computer Science undergraduate degrees, or the Programme Director of the Computer Science (Conversion) MSc (Andrew Calway). Supporting the relevant Head of Year, the Year Group Teachers will coordinate a team of Programme Teaching Assistants, who will provide weekly tutorials to groups of students, to help embed the learning of the course. It will also involve leading tutorials yourself, and supporting studentsâ€™ learning, as well as working to support teaching on unit(s) in the relevant year, or subject to experience, leading teaching on a unit. The roles will be predominantly online initially, but we expect there will be opportunities for on-campus teaching, especially if the COVID situation changes. The roles are new, and are likely to evolve over the course of the year, so it is important you are flexible and adaptable, and that you would relish the opportunity to shape your own work. You will have the opportunity to develop both teaching and community-building activities, and any experience in these will be a benefit.
Subject to experience, there may be opportunities to take on more teaching responsibilities, at the higher grade post, and we especially welcome applicants from people experienced in the subjects taught in our Undergraduate and Postgraduate programmes.</p>

<p>Ideally you will be a recent graduate of a Computer Science undergraduate or postgraduate programme (or an equivalent programme) and having experience of demonstrating or teaching Computer Science subjects would be beneficial, though not essential.
We welcome applications from all members of our community and are particularly encouraging those from diverse groups, such as members of the LGBT+ and BAME communities, to join us.</p>
