    CSS' AGM is upon us once again! Join us in <b>MVB 1.11(A) at 17:00, Friday 3rd May</b> to vote on motions and committee nominees.
</p>

<p>
    If you're abroad this year or can't attend the AGM - don't worry! You can still nominate yourself/submit a motion. We recommend recording a short video of yourself speaking so that we can play it at the AGM. If you like, we can read out a written statement instead.
</p>

<p>
    (Nominations for First-Year Rep and Post-Grad Rep will be occur after the start of the next university year)

<h2>Roles</h2>
<br>

<a class="agm btn btn--dark" href="http://bit.ly/css-agm19-roles">
    Nominate yourself for a role!
</a>

<p>
    Could you see yourself at the helm of our next Hackathon or Bar Crawl? Being a committee member is a great way to gain experience running events, dealing with industrial sponsors and communications. And to boot - it's a whole lot of fun!
</p>
<p>
    You will have a chance to speak for 60s (once, regardless of how many positions you apply for) during the AGM.
</p>

<p>
    Here's a taste of what each role does:
</p>

{% for role in site.data.roles %}
    <div class="agm-role">
        <h6 class="agm-role-title">{{ role.role }}</h6>
        <p class="agm-role-desc">
            <ul>
                {% for point in role.desc %}
                    <li>{{ point }}</li>
                {% endfor %}
            </ul>
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="agm-role-desc">{{ role.desc }}</p> -->
    </div>
{% endfor %}

<h2>Motions</h2>
<br>

<a class="agm btn btn--dark" href="http://bit.ly/css-agm19-motions">
    Submit a motion!
</a>

<p>

</p>
<p>
    Constitutional changes must receive a two-thirds majority. Non-constitutional motions must receive a majority.
