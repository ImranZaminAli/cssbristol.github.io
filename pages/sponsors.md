## Tech Talk Top Tips

Tech Talks are a great way to generate interest among students.

Generally we expect audiences of between 30 and 60 students, but it varies depending on the topic and time of the year. Talks normally last about 45 minutes, with a few minutes for questions. We encourage students to stay afterwards if they have further questions for the speaker. We advertise talks through the website, Facebook and posters, as well as providing lunch for attendees.

Here are some of our top tips for a successful Tech Talk:

* **Choose an interesting, technical topic.** CS students at Bristol enjoy in-depth technical talks. Past speakers have successfully presented topics such as linkers, JVM internals and testing.
* **Focus on something that's unique to your organisation.** What is the one thing that you do better than anyone else? What can students learn from your organisation that nobody else can teach?
* **Provide real-world insight.** Students read plenty of lecture slides and technical documentation, but it's not always clear how the concepts translate into real businesses. Honest and informative observations from the 'real world' will be well received.
* **If you're looking to hire interns or graduates, make your point effectively.** Interested students will already have read the information on your careers website. A talk is your chance to offer an authentic look inside your organisation. Set aside a few minutes at the beginning or end of your talk to explain what roles you are hiring for. Demonstrate the exciting and difficult problems that students could be working on by linking your talk to the day-to-day work of your engineers.
