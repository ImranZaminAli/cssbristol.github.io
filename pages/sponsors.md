Whether you're interested in running an event or looking to begin a longer collaboration, we're always happy to hear from potential partners.

## Why CSS?
We hold more than **30** hackathons, discussion
panels, talks, and social events each year.

Every CS student at the University of Bristol
is part of CSS, meaning we have around 600
undergraduates and more than 250 postgraduates
at any one time. Not to mention our large number
of alumni in our 2300+ member Facebook group.

Sponsorship is a highly effective way to promote
your brand and attract top talent - we can ensure
you are visible to students throughout the year.
Many of our students go on to work at companies
that sponsor us.

We have worked with: Bloomberg, Graphcore,
Microsoft, ARM, Dyson, and more in the
past, and are always happy to hear from potential
partners.

We offer year long packages or the opportunity to
run individual events; see below for more details.

## What do we offer?

### Year long sponsorship
This offers the best oppertunity to meet and interact with students year round with consistent brand engagement

### Custom Event
Running a custom event is the perfect opportunity to
show students interesting technical problems you work
on, what it’s like to work at your company, and what
you’re looking for in new engineers.
We help our partners run social events and programming
contests, such as game jams, data science challenges,
capture the flags, and more. These are popular and
attract 50 to 100 students. If you want to run any kind of
event, get in touch

### Sponsor an Existing Event
We run a number of recurring events which are popular
with students. Sponsors of these events will be involved
in planning, prominently featured in all advertising, and
have access to students for the duration of the event:
• Autumn Event (November 2020): the key event of our
first term - e.g, a hack-night, gamejam or competition.
• 24 Hour Hackathon (February 2021): the biggest
event of our calendar, a large-scale hackathon.
Get in touch for more details and pricing.

### Tech Talk
You send the presenter; we organise advertising,
tech setup, and venue - physical or digital. We usually
expect an audience of around 30 to 50 people (variable
depending on the availability and interest of students).
Past talks have covered topics such as high-performance
computing, JVM internals, formal hardware verification
and banking security.

## Tech Talk Top Tips

Tech Talks are a great way to generate interest among students.

Generally we expect audiences of between 30 and 60 students, but it varies depending on the topic and time of the year. Talks normally last about 45 minutes, with a few minutes for questions. We encourage students to stay afterwards if they have further questions for the speaker. We advertise talks through the website, Facebook and posters, as well as providing lunch for attendees.

Here are some of our top tips for a successful Tech Talk:

* **Choose an interesting, technical topic.** CS students at Bristol enjoy in-depth technical talks. Past speakers have successfully presented topics such as linkers, JVM internals and testing.
* **Focus on something that's unique to your organisation.** What is the one thing that you do better than anyone else? What can students learn from your organisation that nobody else can teach?
* **Provide real-world insight.** Students read plenty of lecture slides and technical documentation, but it's not always clear how the concepts translate into real businesses. Honest and informative observations from the 'real world' will be well received.
* **If you're looking to hire interns or graduates, make your point effectively.** Interested students will already have read the information on your careers website. A talk is your chance to offer an authentic look inside your organisation. Set aside a few minutes at the beginning or end of your talk to explain what roles you are hiring for. Demonstrate the exciting and difficult problems that students could be working on by linking your talk to the day-to-day work of your engineers.
